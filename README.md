###### Understanding the Red wine dataset
It has a total of 11 physiochemical features and 1 target variable (Quality).
Let's understand these features.
1. Fixed Acidity
...Non-volatile acids like tartaric, malic, citric acids that don't evaporate easily. It is measured in g/dm^{3} (grams per cubic decimeter). It contributes to the wine's **tartness**. Higher values indicate better freshness, but excessive amounts result in harsh taste.
2. Volatile Acidity
...Acids like acetic acid that evaporate. It is measured in g/dm^{3}. High values of these acids results in low quality of wine. Generally, lower is better, as it negatively influences quality.
