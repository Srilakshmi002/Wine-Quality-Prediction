# Wine-Quality-Prediction

### About
The original dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes two datasets about red wine and white wine. 

### Approaches Followed:
#### Classification
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- KNN
  
#### Regression
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistical Regression

#### Understanding the Red wine dataset
It has a total of 11 physiochemical features and 1 target variable (Quality).
Let's understand these features.
1. Fixed Acidity
- Non-volatile acids like tartaric, malic, citric acids that don't evaporate easily. It is measured in g/dm^3 (grams per cubic decimeter). It contributes to the wine's **tartness**. Higher values indicate better freshness, but excessive amounts result in harsh taste.
2. Volatile Acidity
- Acids like acetic acid that evaporate. It is measured in g/dm^3. High values of these acids results in low quality of wine. Generally, lower is better, as it negatively influences quality.
3. Citric Acid
- A type of acid, occurs naturally in grapes. Measured in g/gm^3. It adds freshness and flavour. Moderate amounts are good. Having too little leads to flat wine, too much leads to sour.
4. Residual Sugar
- It's a sugar left after fermentation. Measured in g/dm^3. Slightly high sugar gives smoother taste. Too much leads to sweet wine. Generally, doesn't vary much in dry wines.
5. Chlorides
- Salt content in the wine. Measured in g/dm^3. High chlorides leads to poor quality. It often comes from bad storage or contaminated water.
6. Free Sulphur Dioxide
- The SO<sub>2</sub> available which acts as an antioxidant/preservative. Measured in mg/dm^3. It protects against microbial growth. Needed in small amounts. Having too high can affect taste/smell.
7. Total Sulphur Dioxide
- It's a total of bound and free SO<sub>2</sub>.
  Bound: SO<sub>2</sub> attached to other molecules like sugars or aldehydes. It doesn't protect or preserve the wine directly. Since we canâ€™t smell or taste it, but it still                 contributes to the total.
  Total SO<sub>2</sub> = Free SO<sub>2</sub> + Bound SO<sub>2</sub>
  Measured in mg/dm^3. Having too little leads to spoilage or microbial growth. Too much leads to bad smell, irritation, lower quality. Ideally, free SO<sub>2</sub> is at safe levels, and bound SO<sub>2</sub> is kept low to reduce total SO<sub>2</sub>.
8. Density
- It's a wine density (mass/volume). Measured in grams/cm^3. Related to sugar/alcohol content. Higher density leads to sweeter or unfinished fermentation. Too high density means lower quality. Typically wine density ranges from 0.990 - 0.996 is a good sign of dry red or white wines. If it's above 0.997, the wine might be sweet (if intentional), unfermented or unfinished.
9. pH
- It's a acidity level. Lower pH means more acidic. Measures through the pH scale of 0-14. It affects preservation, color, stability. Ideal winr pH is ~3-4. Extreme values results it bad wine.
10. Sulphates
- Sulphur compounds acting as preservatives (Not same as SO<sub>2</sub>). Measured in g/dm^3. Small amounts improve helf life. Can also affect mouthfeel. Having on high amounts is better for preservation but not always better quality.
11. Alcohol
- It's the Ethanol content from fermentation. Measured in % by volume. It is a major contributor to flavour, aroma, and body. Higher alcohol is often associated with higher quality, but balance is key.
12. Quality **(Target Variable)**
- It's a human rated wine quality score. Average sensory tests by wine experts.

### Quick Insights on Impact (from typical correlations).
| Feature | Common Impact on Quality |
| --- | ---|
| Volatile Acidity | Negative |
| Alcohol | Positive |
| Sulphates | Positive (moderate) |
| Residual Sugar | Neutral/Low Impact |
| Total Sulphur Dioxide | Negative (if too low) |
| pH | Weak to moderate impact |
| Density | Negative (if too high) |
